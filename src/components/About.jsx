        <p className="text-[16px] opacity-60 leading-relaxed">
          At WeHe Studio, we reimagine spaces through the lens of generative design and computational innovation.
          Rooted in the belief that architecture should evolve with its context, we craft dynamic,
          data-driven solutions for buildings, interiors, and urban environments—always harmonizing creativity with precision.

        <p className="text-[16px] opacity-60 leading-relaxed">
          We harness algorithms, parametric modeling, and BIM workflows to explore thousands of design possibilities,
          ensuring every project is optimized for sustainability, functionality, and aesthetic impact.
          From adaptive furniture systems to large-scale developments, our process merges cutting-edge technology with human-centered storytelling.

          We don`t just design for the future—we design with it. By embedding computational logic into every curve, grid,
          and material choice, we transform static spaces into living ecosystems that grow with their communities.
